        BODYPUMP is a fast-paced, barbell-based workout that's specifically
        designed to help you get lean, toned and fit. It uses a combination of
        motivating music, fantastic instructors and scientifically proven moves
        to help you achieve these targets more quickly than you would working
        out on your own. As muscles repair from the workouts your body's
        metabolism is increased. This means that calories are burned by BODYPUMP
        at an increased rate long after you finish your BODYPUMP class. With
        increased muscle mass, you'll use more energy, resulting in a greater
        rate of weight loss. Because BODYPUMP challenges are targeting your
        major muscle groups the recomendation is that you do no more than two to
        three workouts a week, and make sure you have a day off in between. Add
        two or three cardio workouts into the mix and you'll shape and tone your
        body in no time.
